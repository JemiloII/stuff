# Strings, Numbers, & Loops

## Objectives
* Complete the reading assignments listed for each exercise.
* Work through each exercise.
* For each exercise, consider how Ruby is different than (and similar to) JavaScript / Node.

## Exercises

 Go through each exercise in order: start with the 'Greeting Exercise' and finish with the 'Birthday Helper'.

## Greeting Exercise

Write a program which asks for a person's first name, then middle, then last. Finally, it should greet the person using their full name.

## Deaf Grandma
* Asks the user to write something
* Prints "HUH?! SPEAK UP SONNY!" if the user didn't type in all uppercase
* Prints "NO, NOT SINCE 1944!" if the user types something in all caps
* Each time the program prints "NO, NOT SINCE 1944!", it should print a different, random year between 1930 and 1950.

* [Flow Control](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/chap_06.html) chapter of Learn to Program by Chris Pine

### Stretch:
Extend your Deaf Grandma program: What if grandma doesn't want you to leave? When you shout BYE, she could pretend not to hear you. Change your previous program so that you have to shout BYE three times in a row. Make sure to test your program: if you shout BYE three times, but not in a row, you should still be talking to grandma.

## Birthday Helper
Write a program that helps users find the birth date and age of a person.  
The program should:

* Prompt the user for a name
* Print that person's name and birth date and age based on the data in the `examples/birthday_data.csv` file
