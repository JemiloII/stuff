### With Postgres.app

[Download it now.](http://postgresapp.com/)

After you download, you should unzip, install, and open the app. Now you have a postgres server, which you should be able to see by checking out the little elephant in the top status bar.

You'll need to configure your `$PATH` variable.

If you are using bash, add the following line to ~/.bash_profile, or .zsh_profile if using zsh:
```
export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.4/bin
```

Then you have to learn how to use the app / preference pane etc...
